				<p>Social science research has demonstrated that the human brain has evolved a strong ability to recognize and react to information but a fairly poor ability to recall information from memory. Other studies have shown that a more diverse group is generated when candidates are identified from a list, rather than selecting based purely on recall.</p>

				<p>The DiversifyCAZymes initative aims to identify researchers who study CAZymes who are women and/or from a group traditionally underrepresented or underserved in the sciences, including those from racial or ethnic minorities, those with disabilities, people who identify as LGBTQIA, people not primarily educated or working in English, and so on. Our goal is to help symposium organizers, award committees, recruitment committees, etc. identify CAZyme researchers who might diversify their pool. Better science gets done when more diverse mindsets are focussed on the problem at hand.</p>
