#### Things to consider before nomination:

* This is a **self-nomination** form: entries submitted on behalf of someone else will be deleted. This list is  intended for individuals who have completed a PhD or are currently undertaking PhD research. Note that our LinkedIn group and Twitter page often share adverts for PhD positions, if you are a student seeking to work in the CAZyme field.

*  Please note that the self-identification categories are not perfect but are the result of discussion and compromise with input from many people from different constituencies. Please use the free response areas to clarify or add additional information about yourself.

* **Remember this is a public directory. If you self-identify with any of the mentioned categories, you consent to making your self-identification publicly visible in this online directory.**

* Note that not all listed identities/categories have legal protection in all locations!
